# About Notes
1. Try to first include an ELI5 explanation.
2. Focus on strong, descriptive verbs and a narrative that can easily be visualized.
3. Try to sprinkle as many anthropomorphic definitions/traits as possible, e.g. the protein *hugs* instead of binds.
5. You can italicize these cool verbs.
6. Add visuals (images, Biorender renders, Excalidraw drawings) whenever possible.
7. Use admonition.
8. You can add tags at the end, little and generic.
9. Frequently revisit old notes to maintain consistency.
