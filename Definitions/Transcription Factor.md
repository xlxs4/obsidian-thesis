# Transcription Factor
Is a [[Protein]] that controls which genes are active from the whole set (turns them ON or OFF -> selective gene expression). TFs can help the cell to respond to the environment, guide processes such as cell division, cell growth, cell death and cell migration. To do so, a TF searches first for  its [[Binding Site]] (i.e. [[DNA]] sequence that it recongnizes).  It doesn't "fall from the sky" onto the DNA, testing one spot at the time; that is rather inefficient. Rather, it *hugs* the DNA backbone (interacts non-specifically). Then, it *rotates* and *slides* along it, searching for it:
| ![[tf-hugs.png\|300]] | ![[tf-hugs2.png\|300]] |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ![[tf-hugs3.png\|300]] | ![[tf-hugs4.png\|300]] |
After it locates the site, it binds to it by changing shape ([[Conformational Change]]), in order to stay locked in-place:

Then, it can interact with nucleotides on the interior of the helix. It interacts with other proteins for [[Transcription]] purposes. It works alone or together with other proteins, in a complex. It either *promotes* (as an [[Activator]]) or *blocks* (as a [[Repressor]]) the recruitment of [[RNA]] [[Polymerase]]. It can also *recruit* other [[Coactivator]] or [[Corepressor]] proteins in the complex. 

Post-binding, it can become dislogdged due to the DNA moving, or during the interaction with the other proteins:
| ![[tf-bump.png\|300]] | ![[tf-bump2.png\|300]] |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |

The TF can move from one part of the sequence to another, and it can do short hops to bypass either other proteins that are hugging the DNA, or tangled/compacted DNA sections:
| ![[tf-hops.png\|300]] | ![[tf-hops2.png\|300]] |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
It can also do big jumps, jumping to a different strand (even from one [[Chromosome]] to another!). 

The TFs interact to create a complex language of gene expression.

Some TFs bind to a section of a [[Promoter]], usually in a region called a "TATA box", since thymine-adenine pairs are easier to pry apart, given that they make one fewer hydrogen bonds than a CG pair.
Binding to DNA occurs due to a binding domain that has affinity for a specific sequence of nulceotides in the promoter. The transcription factor also has an activation domain, which will bind to other regulatory proteins that enhance transcription.
A transcription factor can have one or more of either of these types of domains.
