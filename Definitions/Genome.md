# Genome
Provides (_not_ is) the complete set of hereditary information (carried by the organism as well as its individual cells).

Usually, the genome is used as an abstraction, referring to a set consisting of different [[Gene]] types, according to base sequnce or function (or [[Genetic Locus]]).
Example: a two-celled [[Haploid]] organism like below.

The genome does not perform an active role in the development of the organism. Instead, the _products_ of expression of nucleotide sequences within the genome, are what determines development.
The genome consists of [[DNA]] sequences, except in the case of [[RNA]] viruses, where it consits of RNA sequences instead.
The genome (DNA/RNA sequence), through a complex series of interactions, directs production of all the RNAs and [[Protein]]s of the organism, at the appropriate time and within the appropriate cells.
- **Physically**, the genome (in the case of DNA) can be divided into a number of different DNA molecules, or [[Chromosome]]s.
- **Functionally**, the genome is divided into [[Gene]]s.
