# Polymerase
Is an enzyme that synthesizes chains of nucleic acids or polymers.
[[DNA]] and [[RNA]] polymerases recognize the template strand and synthesize DNA or RNA, respectively. DNAP is used in [[DNA Synthesis]] (and [[DNA Replication]]); whereas RNAP is used in [[Transcription]].
Some polymerases are instead template-agnostic; polymerases can be template-dependent or template-independent (or both).
