# Nuclease
Is an enzyme that cleaves the (phosphodiester) bond(s) between nucleotides of nucleic acids. Nucleases are grouped into:
- **Exonucleases**, which cleave only residues at the ends of the chain.

- **Endonucleases**, which cleave everywhere along the chain.

Some cleave only double-stranded molecules (usually [[dsDNA]]), others only single-stranded ones, others can do both.
Some are fairly indescriminate about the sequence that they cleave, while others can be very sequence-specific (e.g. [[Restriction Endonuclease]]s).
