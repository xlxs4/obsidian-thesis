# Gene
A gene is a genomic sequence ([[DNA]]/[[RNA]]) that encodes the synthesis ([[Translation]]) of either a single RNA type or a [[Protein]]. 

As a black-box definition, we can say that a gene is a genomic sequence that is somehow involved in a metabolic process, other than its own replication, in the cell it is a part of.
A _type_ (or _kind_, or _class_) of a gene can be thought of as a mathematical set, where it groups genes that share a common characteristic. This is, essentially, an abstraction layer, to avoid having to deal with the variation (e.g. chemical, geometric...) from one individual sequence to another. Usually, types are used to group genes that share a base sequence or _function_.

The gene is the functional unit of heredity.
Genes are in a [[Chromosome]] (linear array of genes). The location of the gene inside the chromosome is called a [[Genetic Locus]]. The gene can exist in alternative forms, called [[Allele]]s, which are all found in its locus.
